# Request Directory

Request Directory is an open-source alternative to RapidAPI, allowing you to use
APIs for a variety of tasks with a single API key!

## Docker

To build the docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t request-directory .
```

To run the docker container, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p3000:3000 request-directory
```

## APIs

Request Directory contains a bunch of different APIs that are all hosted on
the same domain.

### NudeNet

Details about the NudeNet API can be found [here](https://github.com/notai-tech/nudenet).

To start the NudeNet API, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p2000:8080 ghcr.io/notai-tech/nudenet:latest
```

This will make the API available at `http://localhost:2000/infer`.

Request Directory uses this API locally at `http://localhost:3000/v1/nudenet` or
`https://request.directory/v1/nudenet` in production.

## FAQ

### Will you be adding more APIs?

Yep! I think Request Directory is super useful and itâ€™s a great way to
discover new APIs. If you have any suggestions, please open an issue or
submit a PR.

### Will Request Directory get any AI models?

No. The official instance of Request Directory wonâ€™t get any AI models.

It will, however, host APIs that use AI models (like those from OpenAI).

### Why Supabase?

I chose Supabase for a couple reasons:

1. Supabase is open source (and has a generous free tier)
2. Supabase is easier to get up and running rather than setting up Postgres, S3,
   and Next Auth.
3. I just so happened to start this project while Supabase was running their
   Twelfth Hackathon and I wanted to winðŸ˜‚
